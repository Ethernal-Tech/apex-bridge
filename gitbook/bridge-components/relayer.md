# Relayer

Relayer is an off-chain component of the validator, responsible for submitting transactions to the destination blockchain. Only one instance of the Relayer needs to be running, and it can be operated by any validator in the system. It retrieves a confirmed batch that is ready for execution on the destination chain, from the bridge's smart contract, and signs it with all the necessary signatures of validators required to spend the input UTXOs specified in the batch. Once signed, the batch transaction is submitted to the destination blockchain.

In addition, each validator runs a Relayer imitator, which is also an off-chain component. A Relayer imitator handles every chain involved in the bridging process. Its responsibility is to mark all transactions included in a confirmed batch as having been submitted to the destination blockchain. In order to achieve this, it begins by querying the bridge's smart contract to obtain the latest confirmed batch. Using the identifier of that batch, it retrieves the list of transactions that were grouped within the batch. Each of these transactions is then processed, and its status is updated to _submittedToDestination_.
