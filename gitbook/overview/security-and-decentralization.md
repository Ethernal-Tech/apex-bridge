# Security and Decentralization

Skyline's decentralization is established through a network of independent validator nodes, each employing robust consensus mechanisms in conjunction with multisignature UTXO technology. The security of Skyline fundamentally relies on achieving consensus among these independent validators and on having at least one reliable Relayer present.

Multisignature UTXOs add an additional layer of transaction integrity, significantly mitigating the risks associated with unauthorized asset transfers or fraudulent activities. Each transaction demands multiple signatures from separate validators, ensuring no single party can compromise or manipulate asset movements unilaterally.

Additionally, Skyline includes an automatic refund mechanism, enhancing transactional security by swiftly and securely returning user assets in the event of invalid or failed bridging requests.

The decentralized architecture provides strong resistance against centralized points of failure, resulting in a highly resilient and secure cross-chain bridging solution. Overall, these mechanisms ensure Skyline consistently delivers secure and dependable cross-chain asset transfers between Cardano and Apex Fusion ecosystems.
